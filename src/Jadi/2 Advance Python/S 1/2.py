# Object Oriented Programming(OOP), C++ is OOP for C,OOP in Python: x = q, w, e, ... and y = x = s, d, f,... and z = g,... and j = g,v,...
# f = j = y = x = t, e, w, q,..., So we can say OOP kind of connected to Alising

Example2 = Jadi = Person()
# Jadi is a Object of Person Class, in int(Number) we can say int is a class for number object
